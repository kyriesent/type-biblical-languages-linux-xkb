XKB keymaps for typing in Biblical Greek and Hebrew

See usage instructions here: https://frame-poythress.org/keyboard-entry-of-polytonic-greek-and-biblical-hebrew-in-gnulinux-2014/. Props to Vern Poythress for posting these and making them available to everyone.

tl;dr: install these files in `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols` to enable these keymaps (keyboards) for Greek and Hebrew in Linux.

I've remapped SHIFT+1, SHIFT+2, and SHIFT+3 to Hatef Patah, Hatef Segol, and Hatef Qamats because:

1. ALTGR doesn't seem to work very well, at least not for me, and apparently not for a lot of people on StackExchange. Even Vern had to use a setup script and a specific desktop... and I'm not about to install a new desktop just for an underline with a colon next to it.

2. If you're like me, you're typing in Hebrew for academic purposes and you really don't need "!", "@", oe "#" when writing in Hebrew.
